# 📦 ElectroShop Inventory Management Application

## 🌐 Overview

This project is an inventory management application for a fictional electronics store, ElectroShop. The application is designed to help ElectroShop manage its vast array of products, from mobile phones to televisions and computers. With a high demand for its products, ElectroShop needs an efficient way to manage its inventory, and this application aims to provide that solution.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Data Models** 📝: The application includes models to represent the products sold by ElectroShop, with attributes such as name, description, price, and quantity in stock. It also includes models to represent customer orders and the customers themselves.

2. **Database** 🗃️: The application uses a database to store all of ElectroShop's information. The database is designed with relationships between the different models in mind. For example, an order is related to a customer and multiple products.

3. **Backend** ⚙️: The backend of the application interacts with the database, providing endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each data model. It also provides endpoints for generating reports and statistics on ElectroShop's inventory performance.

4. **API Documentation** 📚: The application's API is documented using tools like Swagger, making it easier for other developers and the ElectroShop team to use.

5. **User Interface** 🖥️: While the main focus is on the backend, the application also includes a simple user interface. This interface, which can be developed using pure JavaScript or a framework like Svelte, Angular, or React, allows the ElectroShop team to interact with the application in an easy and intuitive way.

6. **Testing** ✔️: The application includes tests to ensure it works as expected and can handle ElectroShop's demand.

7. **Deployment** 🚀: The application is designed to be deployed so that ElectroShop can use it. Services like Heroku or AWS can be considered for this purpose.
